CRYPTANALYSIS IS THE STUDY OF ANALYXING INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE STUDY OF ANALYZING INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO STUDY THE HIDDEN ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEMS

CRYPTANALYSIS IS USED TO BREACH CRYPTOGRAPHIC SECURITY SYSTEMS AND GAIN ACCESS TO THE CONTENTS OF ENCRYPTED MESSAGES EVEN IF THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY IS UNKNOWN

IN ADDITION TO MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS CRYPTANALYSIS INCLUDES THE STUDY OF SIDE CHANNEL ATTACKS THAT
DO NOT TARGET WEAKNESSES IN THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS THEMSELVES BUT INSTEAD EXPLOIT WEAKNESSES IN THEIR WEAK IMPLEMENTATION

EVEN THOUGH THE GOAL HAS BEEN THE SAME THE METHODS AND TECHNIQUES OF CRYPTANALYSIS HAVE CHANGED DRASTICALLY THROUGH
THE HISTORY OF CRYPTOGRAPHY ADAPTING TO INCREASING CRYPTOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY RANGING FROM
THE PEN AND PAPER METHODS OF THE PAST THROUGH MACHINES LIKE THE BRITISH BOMBES AND BOLOSSUS COMPUTERS AT BLETCHLEY
PARK IN WORLDWAR TWO TO THE MATHEMATICALLY ADVANCED COMPUTERIZED SCHEMES OF THE PRESENT

METHODS FOR BREAKING MODERN CRYPTOSYSTEMS OFTEN INVOLVE SOLVING CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED PROBLEMS IN PURE MATHEMATICS THE BEST KNOWN BEING INTEGER FACTORIZATION

GIVEN SOME ENCRYPTED DATA THE GOAL OF THE CRYPTANALYSTIS TO GAIN AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE ORIGINAL UNENCRYPTED DATA

TIS USEFUL TO CONSIDER TWO ASPECTS OF ACHIEVING THIS

THE FIRST IS BREAKING THE SYSTEM THAT IS DISCOVERING HOW THE ENCIPHERMENT PROCESS WORKS

THE SECOND IS SOLVING THE KEY THAT IS UNIQUE FOR A PARTICULAR ENCRYPTED MESSAGE OR GROUP OF MESSAGE
